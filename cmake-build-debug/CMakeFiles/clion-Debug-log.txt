CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:1 (project):
  cmake_minimum_required() should be called prior to this top-level project()
  call.  Please see the cmake-commands(7) manual for usage documentation of
  both commands.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:3 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.


CMake Warning (dev) at /home/tomer/Downloads/clion-2023.2/bin/cmake/linux/x64/share/cmake-3.26/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (SDL2main)
  does not match the name of the calling package (SDL2).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cmake/sdl2/FindSDL2.cmake:318 (FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS)
  CMakeLists.txt:74 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) at lib/CMakeLists.txt:29 (target_link_libraries):
  Policy CMP0023 is not set: Plain and keyword target_link_libraries
  signatures cannot be mixed.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0023" for policy
  details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this
  warning.

  The keyword signature for target_link_libraries has already been used with
  the target "emu".  All uses of target_link_libraries with a target should
  be either all-keyword or all-plain.

  The uses of the keyword signature are here:

   * lib/CMakeLists.txt:23 (target_link_libraries)
   * lib/CMakeLists.txt:24 (target_link_libraries)

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
